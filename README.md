Hello! This is my website for a school club. You can view my demo video here: https://youtu.be/xoRQiB5DQnE

## NOTE
The images are not mine and are credited to the original owners/creators.
Also, to run it, run on replit (I'm pretty sure you can git clone into replit now) or VScode live server (for me it was very slow though). 

## Inspiration
I've always wanted to make a club where we would construct projects for competitions and the community. As I enter my second year of high school, I want to start up and renovate some clubs at Merivale HS. So, I made a website for the MHS RoCo club. 

## What it does
This website has three main pages: Home/Landing/About Us, Subteams, and Join Us
It's easy to navigate and has a nice design coded through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How we built it
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code up the whole thing. I looked at some reference websites for a layout, downloaded some images, and coded it up.

## What we learned
I learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already had some experience with the languages a few times before, but I never truly invested in learning them properly. However, through this hackathon and experience, I've gained some valuable experience, which will help my future web development work.

## What's next for MHS RoCo Club
I think I want to clean it up and add some more interesting & interactive JS elements. I also want to add a Donate page and create a proper Instagram account if possible. I also want to put it on a proper domain (I tried but it gave me an error).
